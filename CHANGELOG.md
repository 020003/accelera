# Changelog

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- **GPU Process Inspector** — new `Processes` tab per host with deep process analysis: PID, resolved name, command line, user, VRAM usage, uptime, CPU%, AI runtime detection (Ollama/SGLang/vLLM/Triton/PyTorch), and model name resolution via Ollama `/api/ps` and SGLang `/v1/models`; auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
- **Enriched GPU card processes** — process list on GPU cards now shows resolved names, runtime badges, model names, and AI category indicators instead of bare PIDs
- **AI Model Benchmark Runner** — new `Benchmark` tab to test Ollama/SGLang model throughput with preset prompts; measures tokens/sec, TTFT, generated tokens, total duration; results persisted in SQLite
- **Webhook notifications** — enhanced alert webhook delivery with auto-detection of Slack (Block Kit), Discord (embeds), and generic HTTP; new endpoints `GET/PUT /api/alerts/webhook`, `POST /api/alerts/webhook/test`
- **SGLang Runtime integration** — auto-discovery via `/api/sglang/discover`, UI badges, model counts, and per-host tags mirroring the existing Ollama pattern
- **SGLang token tracking** — backend scrapes SGLang usage statistics for TPS, latency, and request counts
- **Token-based alerts** — alert rules can now target `tps`, `total_tokens`, `request_count`, and `avg_latency` metrics (fleet-level)
- **Dark/light theme toggle** — `useTheme` hook with Sun/Moon toggle in Dashboard and Advanced Visualizations headers; state persisted in localStorage
- **CORS nginx proxy** — all frontend fetch calls route through `/api-proxy/` on nginx, eliminating cross-origin issues and keeping backend IPs out of the browser
- **Dynamic currency selection** — `useCurrency` hook with currency selector in Settings; all cost displays reflect the chosen currency
- **Production Docker build** — multi-stage `Dockerfile` (Node build → nginx), `nginx.conf` with SPA routing, gzip, asset caching, and `/health` endpoint; `.dockerignore` for faster builds
- **GPU exporter `/health` endpoint** — returns host info, GPU count, and uptime

### Fixed
- **Advanced Visualizations light mode** — replaced hardcoded dark-only colors in `GPUTopologyMap`, `GPU3DHeatmap`, and global CSS with theme-aware values
- **Plotly 3D heatmap theme** — axis labels, tick fonts, grid colors, and scene background now adapt to light/dark mode via MutationObserver
- **ReactFlow light mode** — added CSS overrides for background, controls, and attribution in light theme
- **vis-timeline light mode** — added `.light` CSS overrides for axis text, grid lines, labels, and current-time indicator
- **SGLang data wiped on refresh** — smart-update merge now preserves `sglang` alongside `ollama` between refresh cycles
- **Cost per 1M tokens mismatch** — label and computation now use the correct time-range
- **Fleet/per-host Token charts empty** — replaced `slice()` truncation with full-range downsampling

### Changed
- **Advanced Visualizations redesign** — polished header with theme toggle, larger tabs, card-wrapped legends with uppercase tracking labels, improved loading/error states with animated indicators
- **Cost metric unit** — "Cost per 1K tokens" → "Cost per 1M tokens"
- **Frontend deployment** — production nginx with pre-built static assets via `docker-compose.frontend.yml`

### Security
- **SSRF protection on nginx proxy** — blocks requests to localhost, loopback, cloud metadata (169.254.x.x), link-local IPv6; restricts proxy to port 5000 only
- **Security headers** — added `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy` to nginx
- **SHA-256 password hashing** — replaced weak 32-bit DJB2 hash with Web Crypto SHA-256; legacy hashes auto-upgrade on next login
- **Secret masking** — `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` and `ALERT_EMAIL_PASSWORD` are never exposed to the frontend API
- **Traceback leak fix** — topology API no longer returns Python tracebacks in error responses
- **Logging hygiene** — replaced bare `print()` calls in alerts.py with proper `logging` module

### Removed
- **AIWorkloadTimeline** — component, all references, and vis-timeline CSS removed
- **Legacy Index page** — `Index.tsx`, `/legacy` route, and associated hooks (`useGpuHistory`, `usePowerHistory`) and components (`GpuHistoryPanel`) deleted
- **Dead components** — `OverviewStats`, `ControlPanel`, `AppLayout`, `AppSidebar` removed
